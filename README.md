# HP-Serial-Number-Warranty-Checker
This program will allow the user to enter a single or multiple HP serial numbers of computers to check the warranty.
It takes use of the selenium libaray to automate the web browser with chromedriver. It will scrape the webpage to get the disired results and then 
output disired results to a csv file for ease of reading. Note, the chromedriver.exe must be in the same directory as the .py file to work.
